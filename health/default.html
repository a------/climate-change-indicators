          <img src="../images/health1.jpg" class="inline-img">
          <p>Heating and cooling degree days measure the difference between outdoor temperatures and the temperatures that people find comfortable indoors. As the U.S. climate has warmed in recent years, heating degree days have decreased and cooling degree days have increased overall, suggesting that Americans need to use less energy for heating and more energy for air conditioning. This pattern stands out the most in the North and West, while much of the Southeast has experienced the opposite results.</p>

          <img src="../images/health2.jpg" class="inline-img">
          <p>Since 1979, more than 9,000 Americans were reported to have died as a direct result of heat-related illnesses such as heat stroke. The annual death rate is higher when accounting for other deaths in which heat was reported as a contributing factor. Considerable year-to-year variability in the data and certain limitations of this indicator make it difficult to determine whether the United States has experienced long-term trends in the number of deaths classified as "heat-related."</p>

          <p>Lyme disease is a bacterial illness spread by ticks that bite humans. Tick habitat and populations are influenced by many factors, including climate. Nationwide, the rate of reported cases of Lyme disease has approximately doubled since 1991. Lyme disease is most common in the Northeast and the upper Midwest, where some states now report 50 to 100 more cases of Lyme disease per 100,000 people than they did in 1991.</p>

          <img src="../images/health4.jpg" class="inline-img">
          <p>The average length of the growing season in the contiguous 48 states has increased by nearly two weeks since the beginning of the 20th century. A particularly large and steady increase has occurred over the last 30 years. The observed changes reflect earlier spring warming as well as later arrival of fall frosts. The length of the growing season has increased more rapidly in the West than in the East.</p>

          <img src="../images/health5.jpg" class="inline-img">
          <p>Warmer temperatures and later fall frosts allow ragweed plants to produce pollen later into the year, potentially prolonging the allergy season for millions of people. The length of ragweed pollen season has increased at 10 out of 11 locations studied in the central United States and Canada since 1995. The change becomes more pronounced from south to north.</p>
