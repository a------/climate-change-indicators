        <h1>Summary</h1>
        <p>This indicator focuses on emissions of carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, and several fluorinated gases—all important greenhouse gases that are influenced by human activities. A number of factors influence the quantities of greenhouse gases released into the atmosphere, including economic activity, population, consumption patterns, energy prices, land use, and technology. </p>
        <div class="card">
        <h2>Key Points</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>In 2014, U.S. greenhouse gas emissions totaled <strong>6,870 million metric tons</strong> of carbon dioxide equivalents.</li>
          <li><strong>Electricity, transportation, and industry</strong> were the largest contributers.</li>
        </ul>
        </div>
        <div style="margin-top:20px;" class="card">
        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>There are several ways to track emissions, such as by measuring emissions directly, calculating emissions based on the amount of fuel that people burn, and estimating other activities and their associated emissions. EPA has two key programs that provide data on greenhouse gas emissions in the United States: the Inventory of U.S. Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Sinks and the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program. See the <a href="#">Greenhouse Gases overview</a> to learn more about these programs.</p>

              <p>This indicator examines trends in unusual temperatures from several perspectives:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>The size and frequency of prolonged heat wave events (Figure 1).</li>
                <li>Unusually hot summer temperatures and cold winter temperatures nationwide (Figures 2 and 3).</li>
                <li>The change in the number of days with unusually hot and cold temperatures at individual weather stations (Figures 4 and 5).</li>
                <li>Changes in record high and low temperatures (Figure 6).</li>
              </ul>
              <p>The data come from thousands of weather stations across the United States. National patterns can be determined by dividing the country into a grid and examining the data for one station in each cell of the grid. This method ensures that the results are not biased toward regions that happen to have many stations close together.</p>
              <p>Figure 1 shows the U.S. Annual Heat Wave Index, which tracks the occurrence of heat wave conditions across the contiguous 48 states from 1895 to 2014. While there is no universal definition of a heat wave, this index defines a heat wave as a period lasting at least four days with an average temperature that would only be expected to occur once every 10 years, based on the historical record. The index value for a given year depends on how often heat waves occur and how widespread they are.</p>
              <p>Figures 2 and 3 show trends in the percentage of the country’s area experiencing unusually hot temperatures in the summer and unusually cold temperatures in the winter. These graphs are based on daily maximum temperatures, which usually occur during the day, and daily minimum temperatures, which usually occur at night. At each station, the recorded highs and lows are compared with the full set of historical records. After averaging over a particular month or season of interest, the coldest 10 percent of years are considered “unusually cold” and the warmest 10 percent are “unusually hot.” For example, if last year’s summer highs were the 10thwarmest on record for a particular location with more than 100 years of data, that year’s summer highs would be considered unusually warm. Data are available from 1910 to 2014 for summer (June through August) and from 1911 to 2015 for winter (December of the previous year through February).</p>
              <p>Figures 4 and 5 show how trends in unusually hot and cold daily temperatures throughout the year vary by location. These maps cover 1,115 weather stations that have operated since 1948. Figure 4 was created by reviewing all daily maximum temperatures from 1948 to 2014 and identifying the 95th percentile temperature (a temperature that one would only expect to exceed in five days out of every 100) at each station. Next, for each year, the total number of days with maximum temperatures higher than the 95th percentile (that is, unusually hot days) was determined. The map shows how the total number of unusually hot days per year at each station has changed over time. Figure 5 is similar except that it looks at unusually cold days, based on the 5th percentile of daily minimum temperatures.</p>
              <p>Many people are familiar with record daily high and low temperatures, which are frequently mentioned in weather reports. Figure 6 depicts trends in these records by comparing the number of record-setting highs with the number of record-setting lows by decade. These data come from a set of weather stations that have collected data consistently since 1950.</p>

              <p>Temperature data are less certain for the early part of the 20th century because fewer stations were operating at that time. In addition, measuring devices and methods have changed over time, and some stations have moved. The data have been adjusted to the extent possible to account for some of these influences and biases, however, and these uncertainties are not sufficient to change the fundamental trends shown in the figures.</p>

              <p>The data for this indicator are based on measurements from weather stations managed by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Figure 1 uses data from the National Weather Service Cooperative Observer Network. Figures 2 and 3 come from the U.S. Climate Extremes Index, which is based on a smaller group of long-term weather stations that are tracked by the National Centers for Environmental Information and referred to as the U.S. Historical Climatology Network. Figures 4 and 5 use data from a somewhat larger set of stations tracked by the National Centers for Environmental Information, known as the Global Historical Climatology Network. Figure 6 uses National Weather Service data processed by Meehl et al. (2009). 11 All of these weather station records are available online at:www.ncdc.noaa.gov, and information about the Climate Extremes Index can be found at: <a href="www.ncdc.noaa.gov/extremes/cei">www.ncdc.noaa.gov/extremes/cei</a>.</p>
